# Data Analytics Techniques

This project uses a subset of the Million Song Database, which contains acoustic features and a `year` column. The objective of this task is to predict the year of release of a track based on its acoustic features.

The project covers the complete standard data analytics pipeline, including the following steps:

1. **Data Visualization**

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Handling outliers (Winsorization and other techniques)
   - Various types of scaling and normalization
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

3. **Training Classical Machine Learning Models**
   - Random Forest
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Linear Regression

4. **Training a Feedforward Neural Network using PyTorch**

5. **Using PyTorch Tabular Models**
   - TabNet
   - TabTransformers

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

7. **Model Evaluation on Test Set**

For more information, you can view the following Jupyter Notebooks:
- `data-visualization.ipynb`
- `ml-sklearn.ipynb`
- `feedforward-pytorch.ipynb`
- `tabular-pytorch.ipynb

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data analytics, from preprocessing to model evaluation, using both classical machine learning models and more advanced neural network models.
